I am a faculty member in the [Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering](http://www.bu.edu/eng/departments/ece/) as well as an affiliated faculty member in the [Center for Information & Systems Engineering](http://www.bu.edu/systems) and the [Division of Systems Engineering](http://www.bu.edu/se), all of which are part of the [College of Engineering](http://www.bu.edu/eng) at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu). 

My research is primarily focused on understanding how to efficiently enable distributed computation in the presence of noise, inspired by ideas from information theory, wireless communications, signal processing, as well as neuroscience.

Some of my recent teaching efforts have focused on creating [high-quality concept videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBV8cFFHvjMrrpoaRzHqu3dkCNZAiWMu2) for our [undergraduate probability class](https://probstatdata.bu.edu).
